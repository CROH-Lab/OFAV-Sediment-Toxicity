# FDEP Year 2 Turbidity Threshold Study

This project, a collaboration between Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), investigated the impact of suspended sediments from coastal development activities on the health of _Orbicella faveolata_, a threatened coral species. The primary objective was to assess the physiological responses of corals exposed to turbidity stress and sediment contaminants, providing data that can inform water quality management and permitting decisions.

This repository will be a living data hub for all analyses and results associated with this project.
